Professor Yuh is a native english speaker and she's one of those people who doesn't speak unless her words really have meaning (i.e. not repetitive or trite). It's apparent that she has prepared her curriculum with a lot of thought, and devotes the second day in the week to group to really interesting discussion, which motivated me to complete all of the readings. Her course covers everything from the Shang\/Zhou dynasties to Korean liberation and beyond, so it moves very quickly and there is a lot of material to remember. She doesn't really give assignments or presentations, so my studying was really just for the exams - but you had better be ready for the exams, because for Professor Yuh, your content is always more important than how well you write a bunch of nothing. Professor Yuh is one of my favorite professors at KU, and she's really in her element with EA History. I would highly recommend taking this class if you're prepared to sit down and memorize dates and timelines and such.","eval_like":"0","eval_comment":"0","eval_hide":"0","wr_term":"2015-1R","wr_time":"2015-09-06 14:15:44","mod_time":"2015-09-06 14:15:44","eval_1":"","eval_2":"","eval_3":"","eval_4":"","eval_5":"","isLiked":false},{"no":"202245","lec_no":"32556","mb_no":"23077","mb_nick":"\uadf8\uc0ac\ub78c","mb_stNum":"201413","eval_total":"4","eval_difficulty":"3","eval_studyTime":"5","eval_attendance":"3","eval_grade":"4","eval_achievement":"4","eval_content":"\uc218\uc5c5\uc744 \ub4e3\ub294 \uc0ac\ub78c\ub4e4 \ub300\ubd80\ubd84\uc774 \uad50\ud658\ud559\uc0dd\uc73c\ub85c \ube44\uc728\uc774 4:1\uc815\ub3c4 \ub429\ub2c8\ub2e4.\r\n\ud55c\uad6d\uc0ac\ub78c\uc774 12\ub144\ub3d9\uc548 \ubc30\uc6b0\ub294 \ud55c\uad6d\uc0ac \ubc0f \ub3d9\uc544\uc2dc\uc544\uc0ac\ub97c \uadf8\ub4e4\uc740 1\ud559\uae30\ub9cc\uc5d0 \ub2e4 \ubc30\uc6cc\uc57c\ud558\uae30 \ub54c\ubb38\uc5d0 \ud655\uc2e4\ud788 \ud55c\uad6d\uc778\uc774 \uc218\uc5c5\uc744 \ub4e3\uae30 \uc218\uc6d4\ud569\ub2c8\ub2e4.","eval_like":"0","eval_comment":"0","eval_hide":"0","wr_term":"2014-2R","wr_time":"2015-01-12 19:39:26","mod_time":"2015-01-12 19:39:26","eval_1":"","eval_2":"","eval_3":"","eval_4":"","eval_5":"","isLiked":false}]
